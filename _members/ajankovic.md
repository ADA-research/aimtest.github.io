<div class="faq">
  <p class="faq_question">Anja obtained her PhD in Computer Science from LIP6, Sorbonne University (France) in December 2021, under the supervision of Dr.-Ing. Carola Doerr.</p> 
  <div class="faq_answer">She held a postdoctoral teaching and research fellow (ATER) position at the same university until December 2023, and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the AIM Chair, RWTH Aachen University (Germany). Her research interests lie in the intersection of evolutionary computation and machine learning, with the primary focus on black-box optimization across different (fundamental and applied) domains. In particular, she focuses on dynamic algorithm selection and configuration, and more broadly on 'on-the-fly' meta-learning for AutoML systems.
