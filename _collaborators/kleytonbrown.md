Kevin is a professor of Computer Science and a Distinguished University Scholar at the University of British Columbia, Canada. He also holds a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute and is an associate member of the Vancouver School of Economics. He received a PhD and an MSc from Stanford University, USA (2003; 2001), and a BSc from McMaster University, Canada (1998). 

Kevinâ€™s research is focused on artificial intelligence, with much of his work at the intersection of computer science and microeconomics, addressing computational problems in economic contexts and incentive issues in multiagent systems. He also studies the application of machine learning to the automated design and analysis of algorithms for solving hard computational problems.
