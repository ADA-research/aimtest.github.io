    <h1>"Future of AI” Summit in Aachen</h1>
    <h2>What is the “Future of AI” Summit about?</h2>

    <p>The unique and exclusive <b>AvH “Future of AI” Summit from 27 to 28 September 2023</b> at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen is organised by two AI experts, Professor Holger Hoos from RWTH Aachen University and Professor Aimee van Wynsberghe from the University of Bonn under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/" class="external">Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</a>.</p>

    <p>Talented young researchers, working in AI or a closely related area at German Universities and carefully and competitively selected by our AI experts, can look forward to joining this once-in-a-lifetime event, during which they will have not only the chance to get to know other young researchers from all across Germany and to discover Aachen (where a major AI week event will happen from 25 to 29 September), but first and foremost to interact with AI professors awarded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and currently established in top-notch German Universities, all this inspired by the Heidelberg Laureate Forum model. Not only will you have the chance to interact with these professors, but also to present your research and gain insights from the leading thinkers in AI across Germany. This opportunity is open to researchers across all disciplines from computer science to humanities and social sciences.</p>
