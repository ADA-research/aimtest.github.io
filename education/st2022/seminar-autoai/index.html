  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This block seminar course will be held in English, towards the end of the 2022 summer semester. Enrollment is restricted to 20 Master students, preferably with a background in AI (including methods from machine learning, optimisation, planning and scheduling, multi-agent systems and other areas of AI). Students will work in groups of two on a range of topics from AutoAI, which spans the automated design and analysis of AI methods, including automated algorithm selection and configuration, automated machine learning techniques (including neural architecture search), and automated performance prediction. Each group will be assigned recently published work from the research literature, which will serve as the starting point for an in-depth investigation of a specific topic; the results of this investigation will be presented in class and compiled into a report.</p>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>Preferably students should have a background in AI (including methods from machine learning, optimisation, planning and scheduling, multi-agent systems and other areas of AI).</p>

  <h3>Registration</h3>

  <p>Registration to the seminar is handled via the <a href="https://supra.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/" class="external">SuPra system</a>.</p>

  <h3>Seminar topics</h3>

  <p>The seminar was hold in a two-day workshop in August 2022 [<a href="data/AutoAI_workshop_schedule.pdf">Workshop schedule</a>].</p>
