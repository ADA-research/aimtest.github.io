  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Solving problems in Operations Research (OR) often requires significant amounts of domain knowledge. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) was adopted in OR to address this challenge. In this seminar, we want to investigate approaches that combine both fields, ML and OR, for solving optimization problems.</p>

  <p>This block seminar course will be held in English.</p>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>Basic knowledge about Operations Research e.g. Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming. Basic knowledge about Machine Learning.</p>

  <h3>Registration</h3>

  <p>Registration to the seminar is handled via the <a href="https://supra.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/" class="external">SuPra system</a>.</p>
