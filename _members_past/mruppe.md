As participant in the Erasmus+ exchange program years ago, Maddy moved from her native Normandy (France) to Aachen, which soon became her adopted city. Thanks to her work at the International Office of RWTH Aachen University, she discovered her passion for event management and international cooperation, which she will put to good use at the Chair for AI Methodology (AIM). In her free time, Maddy learns to play bass guitar, reads scandinavian thrillers and regularly attends cultural events.
