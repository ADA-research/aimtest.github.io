Dirk is a Professor and Chair Holder of the Algorithms and Intelligent Systems chair at the University of Passau, Germany. Previously, he was a Senior Lecturer and headed the Algorithms research group at the University of Sheffield, UK, where he remains as a Visiting Professor. Dirk has also held Postdoc positions at the International Computer Science Institute in California, USA, as well as at the University of Birmingham, UK. He received his Diploma and PhD in Computer Science from the TU Dortmund, Germany (2004;2010).

Dirkâ€™s research focuses on randomized algorithms, algorithmic analysis, and combinatorial optimization. He particularly focuses on the analysis of bio-inspired search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, as well as hybrid and parallel versions of these heuristics.
