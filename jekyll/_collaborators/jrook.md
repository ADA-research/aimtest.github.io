Jeroen received his BSc and MSc in computer science at Leiden University, The Netherlands (2018; 2021). During his master's degree he specialized in AI, and for his master’s thesis he studied model counters by using automated algorithm configuration. Since 2020, Jeroen has been on the core development team of Sparkle. Currently, he is pursuing his PhD degree at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Heike Trautmann, Prof. Dr. Holger H. Hoos and Dr. Maurice van Keulen.

Jeroen’s research focuses on multi-objective approaches for automated algorithm selection and configuration through which he aims to make meta-algorithmics more statistically robust, versatile and powerful. Consequently, his broader research interests lie in multi-objective optimisation and algorithm benchmarking.
