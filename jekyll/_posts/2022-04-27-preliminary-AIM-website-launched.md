Our new Chair for **AI Methodology (AIM; Informatik 14)** is under heavy construction! We are a small group at the moment: the academic part consists of Prof. Dr. Holger Hoos as the chair holder and Dr. Jakob Bossek as assistant professor (Akademischer Rat). Andrea Gibbels supports us in administration and Dipl. Inform. Willi Geffers keeps all technical systems running. At the moment of writing we are still very busy with all kinds of administrative tasks, e.g., ordering furniture for our rooms at Theaterstra√üe 35-39, organising teaching, getting familiar with the workflows at the RWTH.

Today a first preliminary version of our website is launched. More to come soon. Stay tuned!
