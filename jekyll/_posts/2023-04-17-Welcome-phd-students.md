title: Welcome PhD students!
---

This is an exciting time for our research group! This months (April 2023) our group grew considerably; in total three new PhD students joined. 
Julian Dierkes and Wadie Skaf had their first day of work on 1 April while Henning Duwe started today. Wadie will focus on AutoAI for time series. Julian is excited about AutoAI methods for reinforcement learning. Henning will explore two different topics in the beginning: first, automating coding with large language models and second Neural Network Verification. 
We are sure that the three will be an enrichment for the ADA Group!
