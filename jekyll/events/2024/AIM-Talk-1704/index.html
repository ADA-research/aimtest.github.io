  <h1>AIM Colloquium</h1>

  <p>The AIM Colloquium is a series of talks offered by guests scientists from other universities, visiting the Chair of Artificial Intelligence Methodology and presenting cutting-edge research on methods and applications of artificial intelligence. These talks provide insights into exciting research questions and offer space for exchange and discussion.</p>
  <p>This event will be hold in a hybrid format to enable flexibility and expand its reach beyond the university. The presentations are usually between 30 and 45 mins long and there's enough time for Q&A and discussions.

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Technology has been the catalyst for major revolutions societies have gone through, and each new revolution brings social challenges that governments must address. In turn, regulation acts as a form of feedback that directs how the breakthrough technology of the time will have to be adapted. Currently, the most pressing technology revolution is being powered by social media, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI). Though this revolution has been taking place for over a decade now, recent years have seen an astounding increase in the pace with which these applications are being developed and deployed. Not surprisingly, regulatory agencies around the world have been unable to cope with this speed and have just recently started to move from a data-centred to an AI-centred concern. More importantly, governments are still beginning to mature their understanding of AI applications in general, let alone discuss AI ethics and how to promote and sustain accountability in AI applications. In turn, companies that use AI in their applications have also begun to display some public level of awareness, even if often vague and not substantiated by concrete actions. In this talk, we will briefly overview efforts and challenges regarding AI accountability and how major AI players are addressing it. The goal of the talk is to stir future project collaborations from a multidisciplinary perspective.</p>
