  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Evolutionary computation (EC) is an umbrella term for a family of stochastic optimisation algorithms that take inspiration from Darwinian evolution theory. In a nutshell (and very generic) such algorithms maintain a multi-set/population of solution candidates for the optimisation problem at hand. This population evolves in an iterative manner by applying bio-inspired variation and survival-selection operators until some predefined termination criterion is met. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general purpose solvers and have proven to perform exceptionally well in many (black-box) real-world applications, in the field of multi-objective optimisation. (Problem-tailored) EAs are also very successful in combinatorial optimisation. A great example for the latter is the Edge-Assembly-Crossover algorithm (EAX) for the well-known NP-hard Euclidean Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). EAX manages to find (close to) optimal solutions for TSP instances with thousands of notes within minutes or even seconds.</p>

  <p>This block seminar course will be held in English, towards the end of the 2022/2023 winter semester. Enrolment is restricted to at most 20 Bachelor or Master students, preferably with a background in optimisation. Students will work in groups of two on different EC-related topics, including but not limited to evolutionary optimisation in the continuous and discrete domain, genetic programming, evolutionary multi-objective optimisation, principled performance assessment, and more recent EC-branches like evolutionary diversity optimisation~(EDO) and quality diversity~(QD). Each group will be assigned a paper from the research literature, which will serve as the starting point for an in-depth investigation of a specific topic; the results of this investigation will be presented in class and compiled into a report.</p>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>Preferably students should have a background in optimisation.</p>

  <h3>Registration</h3>

  <p>Registration to the seminar is handled via the <a href="https://supra.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/" class="external">SuPra system</a>.</p>
