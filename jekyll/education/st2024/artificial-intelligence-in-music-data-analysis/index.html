  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Music data analysis is a highly interdisciplinary research field with roots in music science, psychology, statistics, computer science, digital signal processing, and beyond. Application scenarios are often user-centered and include music recommendation and classification systems, artificial music generation, recognition of musical properties like tempo, structure, or instrumentation, music transcription, plagiarism detection, alignment of different modalities, etc. Various Artificial Intelligence methods like deep neural networks, automated machine learning, multi-objective optimisation try to solve related problems in an automatic and efficient way.</p>

  <p>In this proseminar, current applications and research studies from state-of-the-art conferences (in particular, the International Society for Music Information Retrieval conference) will be presented.</p>

  <p>Following tasks belong to the participation:
    <ul>
      <li>Reading of a topical paper (it is possible to submit preferences after the kickoff meeting)</li>
      <li>Literature survey regarding the backgrounds and methods (as they are usually not introduced in detail in related papers)</li>
      <li>Presentation (40 minutes) and preparation of a short demo or moderated discussion (10 minutes)</li>
      <li>Participation in the discussions after the talk and a debriefing round</li>
      <li>Writing of a text (14-20 pages) and correction after the first review</li>
      <li>Teamwork (each topic will be presented by two students; individual grading is however possible on demand)</li>
      <li>Creation of a "mini-review" (a questionnaire) after reading of another text</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The seminar will take place at the Chair for Artificial Methodology (Theaterstr. 35-39, room 325), on Wednesdays during the summer term, 14:30-16:00. </p>

  <p>The working language is English.</p>

  <h3>Registration</h3>
