  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Modern computer games consist of large and complex worlds with a vast number of different objects and non-player characters. The interaction with a user and the optimisation of user satisfaction count to the most important issues in game development. Because of an increasing complexity of game worlds, it is very challenging to achieve the best balance with respect to degree of difficulty and also personal preferences of individual human players. Artificial Intelligence algorithms like procedural content generation, reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, or evolutionary algorithms try to solve such problems in an automatical and efficient way.</p>

  <p>In this proseminar, current applications and research studies from state-of-the-art conferences (e.g., IEEE Conference on Games or Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference) will be presented.</p>

  <p>Following tasks belong to the participation:
    <ul>
      <li>Reading of a topical paper (it is possible to submit preferences after the kickoff meeting)</li>
      <li>Literature survey regarding the backgrounds and methods (as they are usually not introduced in detail in related papers)</li>
      <li>Presentation (40 minutes) and preparation of a short demo or moderated discussion (10 minutes)</li>
      <li>Participation in the discussions after the talk and a debriefing round</li>
      <li>Writing of a text (14-20 pages) and correction after the first review</li>
      <li>Teamwork (each topic will be presented by two students; individual grading is however possible on demand)</li>
      <li>Creation of a "mini-review" (a questionnaire) after reading of another text</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The seminar will take place at the Chair for Artificial Methodology (Theaterstr. 35-39, room 325), on Wednesdays during the summer term, 10:30-12:00. </p>

  <p>The working language is English.</p>

  <h3>Registration</h3>

  <p>Registration to the seminar is handled via the <a href="https://supra.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/" class="external">SuPra system</a>.</p>
