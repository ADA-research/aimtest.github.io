<div class="faq">
  <p class="faq_question">Marie received a Computer Science engineering degree from the Technology University of Belfort-Montbéliard (France) in 2012.</p> 
  <div class="faq_answer">During her studies, she did a research internship on Computer Vision at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (Canada), where she stayed until 2015 to complete a Master's there in Natural Language Processing. In 2017, she started a PhD under the supervision of Holger Hoos about automated algorithm configuration at Leiden University (The Netherlands) and is now a postdoc at RWTH Aachen University (Germany). Besides research, she emphasises improving the inner dynamics of her community - by organising research talks in her institute, being part of a Diversity Committee and co-founding the CLAIRE Rising Researcher Network - and the outreach toward future researchers - by participating in initiatives aimed at pre-university students or high-school students.
