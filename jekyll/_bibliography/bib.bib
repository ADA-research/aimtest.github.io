abstract = {We evaluate the performance of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm on a class of dynamic routing problems with a single vehicle. In particular we focus on relating algorithmic performance to the most prominent characteristics of problem instances. The routing problem considers two types of customers: mandatory customers must be visited whereas optional customers do not necessarily have to be visited. Moreover, mandatory customers are known prior to the start of the tour whereas optional customers request for service at later points in time with the vehicle already being on its way. The multi-objective optimization problem then results as maximizing the number of visited customers while simultaneously minimizing total travel time. As an aposteriori evaluation tool, the evolutionary algorithm aims at approximating the related Pareto set for specifically designed benchmarking instances differing in terms of number of customers, geographical layout, fraction of mandatory customers, and request times of optional customers. Conceptional and experimental comparisons to online heuristic procedures are provided.},

@inproceedings{BG2017ExtendedMutation,
abstract = {There exist many optimal or heuristic priority rules for machine scheduling problems, which can easily be integrated into single-objective evolutionary algorithms via mutation operators. However, in the multi-objective case, simultaneously applying different priorities for different objectives may cause severe disruptions in the genome and may lead to inferior solutions. In this paper, we combine an existing mutation operator concept with new insights from detailed observation of the structure of solutions for multi-objective machine scheduling problems. This allows the comprehensive integration of priority rules to produce better Pareto-front approximations. We evaluate the extended operator concept compared to standard swap mutation and the stand-alone components of our hybrid scheme, which performs best in all evaluated cases.},

@inproceedings{BG2017ParetoBeneficial,
abstract = {While finding minimum-cost spanning trees (MST) in undirected graphs is solvable in polynomial time, the multi-criteria minimum spanning tree problem (mcMST) is NP-hard. Interestingly, the mcMST problem has not been in focus of evolutionary computation research for a long period of time, although, its relevance for real world problems is easy to see. The available and most notable approaches by Zhou and Gen as well as by Knowles and Corne concentrate on solution encoding and on fairly dated selection mechanisms. In this work, we revisit the mcMST and focus on the mutation operators as exploratory components of evolutionary algorithms neglected so far. We investigate optimal solution characteristics to discuss current mutation strategies, identify shortcomings of these operators, and propose a sub-tree based operator which offers what we term Pareto-beneficial behavior: ensuring convergence and diversity at the same time. The operator is empirically evaluated inside modern standard evolutionary meta-heuristics for multi-criteria optimization and compared to hitherto applied mutation operators in the context of mcMST.},

abstract = "We build upon a recently proposed multi-objective view onto performance measurement of single-objective stochastic solvers. The trade-off between the fraction of failed runs and the mean runtime of successful runs – both to be minimized – is directly analyzed based on a study on algorithm selection of inexact state-of-the-art solvers for the famous Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Moreover, we adopt the hypervolume indicator (HV) commonly used in multi-objective optimization for simultaneously assessing both conflicting objectives and investigate relations to commonly used performance indicators, both theoretically and empirically. Next to Penalized Average Runtime (PAR) and Penalized Quantile Runtime (PQR), the HV measure is used as a core concept within the construction of per-instance algorithm selection models offering interesting insights into complementary behavior of inexact TSP solvers.",

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE. The Traveling-Salesperson-Problem (TSP) is arguably one of the best-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The two sophisticated heuristic solvers LKH and EAX and respective (restart) variants manage to calculate close-to optimal or even optimal solutions, also for large instances with several thousand nodes in reasonable time. In this work we extend existing benchmarking studies by addressing anytime behaviour of inexact TSP solvers based on empirical runtime distributions leading to an increased understanding of solver behaviour and the respective relation to problem hardness. It turns out that performance ranking of solvers is highly dependent on the focused approximation quality. Insights on intersection points of performances offer huge potential for the construction of hybridized solvers depending on instance features. Moreover, instance features tailored to anytime performance and corresponding performance indicators will highly improve automated algorithm selection models by including comprehensive information on solver quality.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE. We consider a dynamic bi-objective vehicle routing problem, where a subset of customers ask for service over time. Therein, the distance traveled by a single vehicle and the number of unserved dynamic requests is minimized by a dynamic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (DEMOA), which operates on discrete time windows (eras). A decision is made at each era by a decision-maker, thus any decision depends on irreversible decisions made in foregoing eras. To understand effects of sequences of decision-making and interactions/dependencies between decisions made, we conduct a series of experiments. More precisely, we fix a set of decision-maker preferences D and the number of eras nt and analyze all |D|{\^{}}{n{\_}{t}} combinations of decision-maker options. We find that for random uniform instances (a) the final selected solutions mainly depend on the final decision and not on the decision history, (b) solutions are quite robust with respect to the number of unvisited dynamic customers, and (c) solutions of the dynamic approach can even dominate solutions obtained by a clairvoyant EMOA. In contrast, for instances with clustered customers, we observe a strong dependency on decision-making history as well as more variance in solution diversity.},
